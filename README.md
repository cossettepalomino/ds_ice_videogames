# ds_ice_videogames
Ice is an online store that sells video games worldwide. Using a historical dataset of game sales, user and expert reviews, genres, and other relevant features, we will analyze the data to determine the patterns that influence whether a game will be successful or not. Based on this analysis, we will make recommendations for the next year's marketing campaign.

### Project Overview:

- **Data Analysis**: The dataset includes historical sales data, customer and expert reviews, game genres, release dates, and other relevant factors. The goal is to identify trends and patterns that can predict the success of a game.
- **Success Determinants**: We will explore the relationship between variables such as game ratings, genre popularity, marketing efforts, and release timing to determine which factors most strongly predict a game’s success.
- **Marketing Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, we will provide actionable insights and recommendations for the company’s next marketing campaign to increase sales and engagement.

### Key Insights:

- Identifying the key factors that contribute to a game’s success will help the company prioritize marketing efforts and promotions.
- Tailoring marketing strategies based on genre trends and customer preferences can improve the likelihood of a game’s success.
